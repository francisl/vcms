Koni  Class;Koni_Class;;;1;Koni class is the Nato reporting name for a anti-submarine warfare frigate built by the Soviet Union. They were known in the Soviet Union as Project 1159. 14 were built in Zelenodolsk shipyard between 1975 and 1988. Originally intended to replace the older Riga class frigates, but were chosen as a design for export to various friendly navies. The Koni I sub class were designed for European waters and the Koni II were made for warmer waters. One was retained by the Soviets in the Black Sea for training foreign crews.;;12000;rgb;2048;Koni_Class_01.jpg;Frigate;flt,max
M88A2;M88A2;;;1;The M88 is one of the largest all weather armored recovery vehicles currently in use by U.S. Armed Forces and Israel Defense Force, almost 10 tons heavier than the M1 Abrams main battle tank. There are currently three variants, the M88, M88A1 and M88A2 Hercules. The M88 series has seen action most noticeably in Vietnam, the Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and to a lesser extent during the Kosovo War where they were deployed to help recover heavy armored vehicles of the Allied ground units.;;12000;rgb;2048;M88A2_01.jpg;Armored Utility Vehicle;flt,max

AT 105 Saxon;Saxon;;;1;The Saxon was intended to act as a cheap but efficient "battle-taxi" for units that would have to make long journeys from the UK to reinforce the BAOR. As a lightly armoured wheeled vehicle it is much faster - especially on roads - and easier to maintain than a tracked vehicle. Indeed, it shares many parts with commercial trucks, reducing the operating cost.;;12000;rgb;2048;Saxon_01.jpg;Armored Fighting Vehicle;flt,max
