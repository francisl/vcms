Koni_Class_Face;Koni_Class_01.jpg;Koni class is the Nato reporting name for a anti-submarine warfare frigate built by the Soviet Union. They were known in the Soviet Union as Project 1159. 14 were built in Zelenodolsk shipyard between 1975 and 1988. Originally intended to replace the older Riga class frigates, but were chosen as a design for export to various friendly navies. The Koni I sub class were designed for European waters and the Koni II were made for warmer waters. One was retained by the Soviets in the Black Sea for training foreign crews.;Surface;1;Koni_Class

AMX-30_Face;AMX-30_01.jpg;The AMX-30 is a main battle tank designed by GIAT, first delivered to the French Army in 1966. The first five tanks were issued to the 501st Régiment de Chars de Combat (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30 weighed 36 metric tons (40 short tons), and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed that it would have required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank's maneuverability. Protection, instead, was allotted in terms of speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 meters (7.5 ft). The tank's firepower was manifested through its 105-millimeter (4.1 in) cannon, firing an advanced high explosive anti-tank warhead known as the Obus G. The Obus G used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside. Speed was provided by the 720 horsepower (540 kW) HS-110 diesel engine, although the troublesome transmission adversely affected the tank's performance._x000d_

Due to the issues caused by the transmission, in 1979 the French Army began to modernize its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine and the introduction of a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator, amongst other improvements. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridgelayer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface to air missile launcher.;Land;1;AMX-30

120mm_HE_Face;120mm_HE_01.jpg;A new High Explosive service round, currently under development at Rheinmetall will be a successor to the DM12A2 currently in service. The HE round is intended primarily for dealing with long range anti-tank weapons. It is designed to engage soft and semi-hard targets, uses high explosive warhead containing steel and heavy metal fragmentation case. The full caliber warhead is equipped with a time fuse which also has a percussion function which can be activated with or without delay to ensure effective target penetration.
